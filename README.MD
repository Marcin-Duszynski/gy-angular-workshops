# Angular 4 - My __very__ first application

## TypeScript basics and Angular 4 short
This repository contains simple Angular application with few exercises in it - which are created for workshops purpose.

* [`notes-app` Angular 4 app here](notes-app/)
* [TypeScript examples here](typescript-examples/)
* [Final application - deployed on GitHub-Pages](https://michalczukm.github.io/gy-angular-workshops/)

:wave: Keep in mind that this code and workshops **does not cover lot of fields**, nor it doesn't have all-best practices.
It is a nice and easy introduction to `Angular` applications development.

## Presentation in .pdf
* [Just click this link, or clone repository](/gy-angular-presentation.pdf)


## Where to go next with learning Angular?
It might sound too obvious - but do official **Tour of heroes** tutorial. It is really well written (:clap::clap::clap:) and always up to date!

[Just grab it here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)
